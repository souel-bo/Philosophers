Dining Philosophers Problem â€“ Multithreading & Synchronization

This project is an implementation of the classic Dining Philosophers problem using POSIX threads (pthreads) and mutexes to manage synchronization. It focuses on handling concurrency, preventing deadlocks, and ensuring proper resource sharing between philosophers as they alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping.
